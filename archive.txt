I am passionate about discovering new things about the brain and happy to learn any method that will uncover structure in biological data. In particular, I am very interested in the spontaneous activity of the visual cortex and its relationship to perception. I feel very grateful for the opportunity to work on this topic in collaboration with Eduardo Fernandez (Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche, Spain) and Xing Chen (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA).

Apart from the visual cortex, I am also interested in the hippocampus, particularly its subcortical modulation. During my PhD studies I investigated the role of different medial septal subpopulations in generating the hippocampal theta oscillation and triggering locomotion.
